## Database Comparison: 
- SQL-Server VS. Azure SQL DB
  - Migrate from On-Premise SQL-Server to Cloud Azure
- Google BigQuery VS. Azure Cosmos DB

## Python Pipeline: to On-Prem SQL-Server
- sqlcmd
- pyodbc 
- dask
- pyspark, koala

### pyodbc + pandas.read_sql()

### (pyspark's koala equivalent of read_sql)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38376307/create-spark-dataframe-from-sql-query]
> What is Databricks Koala
  - A high level wrapper of PySpark
  - What is its performance improvement from pandas sql? (size of data, speed, memory)
  - What is the gain you have only one machine/work from using koala over pandas
  - ever pyodbc + koala instead of pyspark?
