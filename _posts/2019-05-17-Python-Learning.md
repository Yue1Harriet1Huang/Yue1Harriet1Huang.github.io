## Python decorator dataclass
- encountered this idea when reading [fastai's GitHub repository](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/basic_data.py):
- read about reference post: [Understanding Python Dataclasses](https://medium.com/mindorks/understanding-python-dataclasses-part-1-c3ccd4355c34)
- decorator's idea is similar to Java's `Class implements` either an Abstract Class or an Interface:
  + don't need to specify the `__init__` function as constructor - becomes more like how you define class attributes in Java
  + certain comes along function with the decorator, e.g.  `__repr__`,  `__eq__`
