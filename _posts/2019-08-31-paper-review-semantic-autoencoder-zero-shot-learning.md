On Friday Aug 30 2019, in the meetup I hosted, we reviewed this paper. We mainly covered 3 points:

1. Simple Autoencoder

2. Semantic Autoencoder: 

  (1) What is the difference between semantic autoencoder & simple - and how to achieve it in architecture
 
3. Zero-shot learning

## Q & A

1. what is the difference between **generative model** and **discriminative model**
